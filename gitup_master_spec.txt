üéØ PROJECT VISION & SCOPE

Core Mission Statement

GitUp is a comprehensive git workflow enhancement system designed to introduce security, compliance, and user experience improvements to git operations without imposing technical complexity on users. The system targets the new generation of "vibe" programmers who expect tools to be intuitive and seamless.

Key Philosophical Principles

Universal git enhancement - works with any programming language/project
Security-first approach - never compromises on protection
Flexible but protective - allows user freedom while preventing self-harm
Coexistence with vanilla git - users can choose their preferred workflow
Aggressive compliance enforcement - "persecuting violators/cheaters"
Multi-level user interface - accommodates hardcore and newbie users

Project Relationship to GitGuard

GitGuard: Production-ready security scanner (published on PyPI)
GitUp: Comprehensive workflow wrapper that builds on GitGuard's foundation
Architecture: GitUp uses GitGuard as a component, not a dependency

üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

System Components

Core Engine

File System Architecture

State Management System

Project State Detection Matrix

üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

Security Levels

Compliance Enforcement Rules

GitUp NEVER allows non-compliant operations
Vanilla git usage is detected and logged
Compliance must be restored before GitUp operations
All operations are audited
No bypass mechanisms (aggressive enforcement)

Violation Response System

üë• USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN

Multi-Level Interface System

Hardcore User Mode

Minimal output, maximum speed
Assumes user expertise
Terse messages and quick operations
Environment variable: GITUPMODE=hardcore

Newbie User Mode

Detailed guidance and education
Explanatory messages
Tips and learning opportunities
Environment variable: GITUP_MODE=newbie

Standard User Mode

Balanced approach
Informative but not overwhelming
Default mode for most users

Command Structure

üìö CONTEXT FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS

Project Himalaya Philosophy

This project demonstrates AI-human collaboration:

Human role (Herb): Vision, architecture, user experience design
AI role (Claude): Implementation, code structure, technical details
Collaboration model: Iterative refinement and transparent attribution

Key Architectural Decisions

Non-destructive approach - Never modify user's .gitignore
Aggressive compliance - Zero tolerance for violations
State awareness - Track vanilla git vs GitUp usage
Multi-level interface - Accommodate all user types
Binary distribution - Avoid Python dependency issues

Technical Challenges

State synchronization - Keeping GitUp and git state aligned
Performance optimization - Fast operation checking
Cross-platform builds - GitHub Actions for all platforms
User experience - Balancing power and simplicity

Development Priorities

Foundation first - State detection and management
Security second - Compliance enforcement
Experience third - User interface refinement
Distribution fourth - Production deployment
